###  Description:
This project utilizes linear regression analysis on the USA housing dataset consisting of 1000 data points to predict housing prices. By employing machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, we aim to understand the relationship between various features of the housing dataset and their impact on housing prices.

### Key Details:
- **Dataset:** USA housing dataset with 1000 data points.
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression
- **Train Accuracy:** 91.17%
- **Test Accuracy:** 90.73%

### Project Overview:
The project involves preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values and scaling features as necessary. The linear regression model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for its predictive performance using the remaining data. The achieved train accuracy of 91.17% and test accuracy of 90.73% demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear regression model in predicting housing prices based on the provided features.

### Repository Contents:
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Contains the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Dataset File:** Includes the USA housing dataset used for analysis.

### Instructions:
To replicate the analysis and explore the predictive capabilities of linear regression on the USA housing dataset, clone this repository and run the provided Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to experiment with different features and parameters to further enhance the model's performance.
